As a client, at the first time you got a token. You have 2 options:
a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)
b. use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again.

option a-
pro: less traffic, the requsets to the server are only changes the user made.  
con: when the server change the data and we want to send requset to the server 
the old token will be send so we can get an error, or invalid data (example, data from another user , data we don't expect.)
wil return as a result .  

option b-
pro:the token is the most update . every time the server will preform update we will change the UI and the data accordingly
con: can create many request, more traffic
